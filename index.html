               <h3>Green River, WY</h3>
               <p>
                  We decided to drive so we could enjoy the scenery of passing through 6 different states totaling 32 hours. We made it a two day drive as making the entire drive in one sitting would have been too unbearable. Our halfway mark ended up being Green River, Wyoming. It is a smaller town near the south west corner of the state. Surrounded by rock formations made for wonderful photos and a retro 24 hour diner brought enjoyable meals before continuing with our trip.

               <h3>Oregon Border</h3>
               <p>
                  After 24.5 hours of driving, we finally made it to the Oregon border. We were able to stop at a welcome center on Ontario OR for a photo opportunity. We then ventured inside and they had free posters for sites like Crater Lake, Diamond Lake, 3 sisters mountain range and Portland. Only 7 and a half hours more to travel before we get to our destination of Roseburg, OR.

               <h3>Roseburg, OR</h3>
               <p>
                  We had a few unanticipated stops we decided to make on the way to Roseburg and did not end up arriving until 11 pm. We were staying with Ben’s cousin for the week and luckily enough, she was still awake waiting for us to let us in. We went to bed exhausted and preparing for the week of exploration we had ahead of us. We woke up the following morning taking it easy and recovering from the long drive. We eventually got around and headed to the nearby riverfront and park to see what more the area had to offer than we saw on our first visit. We spent about an hour or so walking around the park and taking photos along the river front before heading back home.

               <h3>Umpqua National Forest</h3>
               <p>
                  The next day we met up with Ben’s other family members and went hiking in the Umpqua National Forest. They have numerous hiking trails for visitors to use, however, we ended up only doing three that day. Each trail was surrounded by trees and most led to some beautiful waterfalls and rock formations. The hikes also made for an amazing work out and had us sleeping great that evening.

                  <h3>The Last Blockbuster in America</h3>
                  <p>
                     With a great week of exploring, shopping, and family time, we had a few more stops to make before making our way back home. After missing this monumental landmark the first time we came to Oregon, I had to make sure we stopped at the last Blockbuster in America. Bend, OR is home to this attraction and still functions as a normal Blockbuster video rental store from the 90. They had many souvenirs and made sure to grab a few along with a photo of the building.

                     <h3>Portland, OR</h3>
                     <p>
                        Lastly we spent a night in Portland, OR to see what the big city had to offer. It did feel similar to St. Louis as it is a major city. They have a very nice downtown area with riverfront to be able to walk along. Blocks full of restaurants, retails stores and bars. We ended up doing quite a bit of shopping and spent way more money than we intended to but overall had the time of our lives.
